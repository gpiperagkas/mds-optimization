# mds-optimization
Multi-directional search optimization algorithm based on the 
algorithm proposed by VJ Torczon(1989), found in the reference:

Torczon, V. J. (1989). Multidirectional search: A direct search algorithm for parallel machines. Rice University.

The algorithm is implemented with basic benchmarking functions for testing. Multiple parameters 
need fine-tuning according to the problem. The algorithm is being restarted when stuck in local minima 
or when is being converged prematurely.

The implementation is provided under a BSD-3-clause license.
